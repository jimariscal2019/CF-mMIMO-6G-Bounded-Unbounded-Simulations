%Implement Algorithm 7.2

%Initialize the current objective function
objec_new = inf;
%Initialize the power control coefficients randomly
eta = pmax*rand(K,1);
%Prepare arrays to store e_k, u_k, and d_k in Algoirthm 7.2
eee = zeros(K,1);
uuu = zeros(K,1);
ddd = zeros(K,1);
%Intialize the difference between current and previous objective values 
diff = 100;

%Initizalize the iteration counter to zero
iterr = 0;
%Go through the algorithm steps if the objective function is improved
%more than 0.0001 or not improved at all
while (diff>0.0001) || (diff<0) 
    %Increase iteration counter by one
    iterr = iterr+1;
    %Update the previous objective value by the current objective value
    objec_old = objec_new;
    
    %Go through all UEs
    for k = 1:K
        %Compute the numerator and denominator in Line 4 of Algorithm 7.2
        numm = sqrt(eta(k,1)*bk(k,1));
        denomm = ck(:,k)'*eta+sigma2(k,1)+eta(k,1)*bk(k,1);
        
        %Update u_k according to Line 4
        uuu(k,1) = numm/denomm;
        %Update e_k and d_k as in Line 5
        eee(k,1) = 1-abs(numm)^2/denomm;
        ddd(k,1) = 1/eee(k,1);
        
    end
    
    %Go through all UEs
    for k = 1:K
        %Compute p_k as in Line 6
        numm = bk(k,1)*ddd(k,1)*uuu(k,1)^2;
        denomm = numm;
        for i = 1:K
            denomm = denomm+ddd(i,1)*abs(uuu(i,1))^2*ck(k,i);
        end
        
        eta(k,1) = min(pmax, ddd(k,1)*numm/(denomm^2));
    end
    
    %Update the current objective value
    objec_new = sum(ddd.*eee-log(ddd));
    %Obtain the difference between current and previous objective values
    diff = objec_old - objec_new;
