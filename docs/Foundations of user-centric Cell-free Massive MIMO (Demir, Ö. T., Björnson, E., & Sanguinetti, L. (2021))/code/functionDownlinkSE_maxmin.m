%
%INPUT:
%bk             = Vector of length K with elements \tilde{b}_k in (7.13)
%ck             = Matrix with dimension K x K where (i,k) is the 
%                 \tilde{c}_{ki} in (7.14)-(7.15)
%wk             = Matrix with dimension L x K where (l,k) is the
%                 expected value of the norm square of the portion
%                 of the normalized centralized transmit precoder of UE k
%                 corresponding to AP l in (7.17)
%preLogFactor   = Pre-log factor in the SE expression of Theorem 6.1
%K              = Number of UEs in the network
%rhomax         = Maximum allowable AP transmit power

%Implement Algorithm 7.3

%Initialize iteration counter to zero

%Compute the denominator in (7.12) for all UEs
denominator = ck'*eta+1;
%Compute SINRs in (7.12) for all UEs
SINR = eta.*bk./denominator;

while max(SINR)-min(SINR)>0.01  %the condition in Line 2 of Algorithm 7.3 with solution accuracy 0.01
    %Increase iteration counter by one
    iter = iter+1;
    
    
    eta = denominator./bk; %Line 3 of Algorithm 7.3
    maxx = max(wk*eta); %Denominator in Line 4 of Algorithm 7.3
    eta = eta*rhomax/maxx; %Line 4 of Algorith√∂ 7.3
    
    %Update the denominator in (7.12) for all UEs
