function SINRs = computeSINRs_MMSE(channel)
%Compute the SINR when using MMSE combining defined in (1.18) for Cellular Massive MIMO 
%and in (1.25) for cell-free setup.
%
%INPUT:
%channel        = M x K channel matrix where the kth column corresponds to
%                 kth UE's channel, i.e., g_k in (1.18) for Cellular Massive MIMO 
%                 or h_k in (1.25) for cell-free setup. 
%
%OUTPUT:
%SINRs           = K x 1 UE SINRs in (1.17) for Cellular Massive MIMO or
%                  in (1.24) for cell-free setup.
