function SE_MMSE = functionComputeSE_cellular_uplink(Hhat,C,BSassignment,tau_c,tau_p,nbrOfRealizations,M,K,nbrBSs,p)
%This function computes the uplink SE using L-MMSE combining for the
%cellular Massive MIMO system.
%
%INPUT:
%Hhat              = Matrix with dimension M*nbrBSs x nbrOfRealizations x K
%                    where (:,n,k) is the estimated collective channel from
%                    all cellular BSs to UE k at channel realization n.
%C                 = Matrix with dimension M x M x nbrBSs x K where (:,:,l,k) is the
%                    spatial correlation matrix of the channel estimation error
%                    between cellular BS l and UE k, normalized by noise variance
%BSassignment      = Matrix with dimension K x 1 containing the
%                    index of the BS that serves a particular UE
%tau_c             = Length of the coherence block
%tau_p             = Length of pilot sequences and number of UEs per cell
%nbrOfRealizations = Number of channel realizations
%M                 = Number of antennas per BS
%K                 = Total number of UEs
%nbrBSs            = Number of BSs and cells
%p                 = Uplink transmit power per UE (same for everyone)
%
%OUTPUT:
%SE_MMSE           = K x 1 matrix where the kth element is the uplink SE of UE k
%                    achieved with L-MMSE combining
